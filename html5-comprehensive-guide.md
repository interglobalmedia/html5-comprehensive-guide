    <h2 class="sentence">The Purpose of This Slide Deck</h2>

The meaning and scope of what is referred to as HTML5 reaches far and wide.

This HTML guide is meant to bring together the list of things that make up HTML5 as comprehensively as possible, thereby informing both aspiring and seasoned developers/designers of what is available under the HTML5 umbrella.

It is an evolving work in progress.

<section class="section">
    <h2 class="sentence">What is HTML5?</h2>

So what IS HTML5? It is the latest version of the standard that defines HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), the code that "describes" web pages. Technically, it is made up of of 3 kinds of code: HTML(5) markup, which provides the page structure, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS(3)), which provides the presentation (styling), and JavaScript, which makes "things happen" on the page.

HTML5 refers to two different concepts. First, it refers to a new version of the HTML language, containing new elements, attributes, and behaviors. Second, it refers to a set of technologies that permits the building of more diverse and powerful web sites and applications (driven by JavaScript).

<section class="section">
    <h2 class="sentence">Why HTML5?</h2>

HTML5 was designed to be usable by all "Open Web" developers.

HTML5 was also designed to deliver almost everything one would need for building web sites or applications online without the help of additional software such as browser plugins.

    <h2 class="sentence">HTML5: Technology Classifications</h2>

`Semantics`: **allows** you to **better describe** your **content**. HTML5 contains semantic elements, elements with (specific) meaning.

`Connectivity`: **allows** you to **communicate** with the `server` in ***new*** ways.

`Offline and Storage`: allows **web pages** to ***store*** `data` **locally** (referred to as localStorage or sessionStorage) on the `client-side` and to **operate** `offline` more ***efficiently***.

Multimedia: makes video and audio "first-class citizens" in the Open Web.

2D/3D Graphics and Effects: allows a much more diverse range of "presentation" options.

Performance and Integration: provides greater speed optimization and better usage of computer hardware.

Device Access: allows for the usage of various input and output devices.

Styling: lets authors write more sophisticated "themes".

<section class="section">
    <h2 class="sentence">Semantics Overview</h2>

According to [Shaye Howe](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/getting-to-know-html/),

> Semantics within HTML is the practice of giving content on the page meaning and structure by using the proper element. Semantic code describes the value of content on a page, regardless of the style or appearance of that content.

<section class="section">
    <h2 class="sentence">The importance of Semantic Elements</h2>

In order to build web sites that make sense both to the web browser and the web developer, we we need to know which HTML elements are best suited to different types of content. In order to know which elements to use for particular types of content we have to know what different elements mean semantically. Additionally, it is important to understand how various elements render to the web page.

In his article entitled [Semantic code: What? Why? How?](https://boagworld.com/dev/semantic-code-what-why-how/), Paul Boag best describes the importance of the meaning of Semantic HTML:

> Semantic code returns to this original concept and encourages web designers to write code that describes the content rather than how that content should look.
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2 class="sentence">HTML5 Semantic Elements</h2>

A semantic element clearly describes its meaning both to the browser and the developer.

According to the [W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) Working Group](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5-diff/), following elements were [introduced](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5-diff/) in HTML5 for better structure:

`<section>`: represents a generic document or application section. It should be used together with the h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements to indicate the document structure.
`<article>`: represents an independent piece of content of a document, such as a blog entry or newspaper article.
`<main>`: represents the main content of the body of a document or application.
`<aside>`: represents a piece of content that is only slightly related to the rest of the page.
`<header>`: represents a group of introductory or navigational aids.
`<footer>`: represents a footer for a section and can contain information about the author, copyright information, etc.
`<nav>`: represents a section of the document intended for navigation.
`<figure>`: represents a piece of self-contained flow content, typically referenced as a single unit from the main flow of the document.
`<details>`
`<figcaption>`: can be used as caption (it is optional).
`<template>`: can be used to declare fragments of HTML that can be cloned and inserted in the document by script.
`<video>`, `<audio>`: for multimedia content. Both provide an API so application Web developers can script their own user interface, but there is also a way to trigger a user interface provided by the user agent. source elements are used together with these elements if there are multiple streams available of different types.
`<track>`: provides text tracks for the `<video>` element.
`<embed>`: is used for plugin content.
`<mark>`: represents a run of text in one document marked or highlighted for reference purposes, due to its relevance in another context.
`<progress>`: represents a completion of a task, such as downloading or when performing a series of expensive operations.
`<meter>`: represents a measurement, such as disk usage.
`<time>`: represents a date and/or time.
`<ruby>`, `<rt>`, `<rp>`: allow for marking up ruby annotations.
`<bdi>`: represents a span of text that is to be isolated from its surroundings for the purposes of bidirectional text formatting.
`<wbr>`: represents a line break opportunity.
`<canvas>`: is used for rendering dynamic bitmap graphics on the fly, such as graphs or games.
`>datalist>`: together with a new list attribute for `<input>` can be used to make comboboxes.
`<keygen>`: represents control for key pair generation.
`<output>`: represents some type of output, such as from a calculation done through scripting.
`<unput>` element's type attribute now has the following new values:

`tel`: defines a field for entering a telephone number. In addition, it is best practice to add a `<label>` tag above the search input for best accessibility practices.
`search`: defines a text field for entering a search string/query. they are functionally the same as inputs of type text. A `name` attribute and corresponding value has to also be set for the search field, otherwise nothing will be submitted. In addition, it is best practice to add a `<label>` tag above the search input for best accessibility practices.
`url`: defines a field for entering a url. The input value is automatically validated (or invalidated) before the form can be submitted. In addition, it is best practice to add a `<label>` tag above the search input for best accessibility practices.
`email`: defines an input field for an e-mail address (part of client-side HTML5 form validation). The input value is automatically validated to ensure it is a properly formatted e-mail address. In addition, it is best practice to add a `<label>` tag above the search input for best accessibility practices.
`date`: defines a date picker. The resulting value includes the year, month, and day. In addition, it is best practice to add a `<label>` tag above the search input for best accessibility practices.
`time`: defines a control for entering a time (no time zone). In addition, it is best practice to add a `<label>` tag above the search input for best accessibility practices.
`number`: defines a field for entering a number. The following attributes specify restrictions:

`max`: specifies the maximum value allowed.
`min`: specifies the minimum value allowed.
`step`: specifies the number intervals allowed
`value`: specifies the default value

In addition, it is best practice to add a `<label>` tag above the search input for best accessibility practices.
`range`: defines a control for entering a number whose exact value is not important (like a slider control). Commonly used as audio element controls for volume or balance, or filter controls. The following attributes specify restrictions:

`max`: specifies the maximum value allowed.
`min`: specifies the minimum value allowed.
`step`: specifies the number intervals allowed
`value`: specifies the default value

`color`: defines a color picker. In addition, it is best practice to add a `<label>` tag above the search input for best accessibility practices.

According to `W3C`,

> The idea of these new types is that the user agent can provide the user interface, such as a calendar date picker or integration with the user's address book, and submit a defined format to the server. It gives the user a better experience as his input is checked before sending it to the server meaning there is less time to wait for feedback.

<section class="section">
    <h2 class="sentence">Styling</h2>

CSS has been extended to be able to style elements in a much more complex way. This is often referred as CSS3, though CSS is not a monolithic specification any more and the different modules are not all at level 3: some are at level 1 and others at level 4, with all the intermediate levels covered.

`New background styling features` - It is now possible to put shadows on elements using [box-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow), [multiple backgrounds](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5), and CSS [filters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter). You can learn more about these by reading [Advanced box effects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Advanced_styling_effects).

- `More fancy borders` - Not only it is now possible to use images to style borders, using [border-image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-image) and its associated longhand properties, but rounded borders are supported via the [border-radius](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius) property.

`Animating your style` - Using [CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions) to animate between different states or using [CSS Animations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations) to animate parts of the page without a triggering event, you can now control mobile elements on your page.

- `Typography improvement` - Authors have better control to reach better typography. They can control [text-overflow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-overflow) and hyphenation, but also can add a [shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-shadow) to it or control more precisely its decorations. Custom typefaces can be downloaded and applied thanks to the new [@font-face](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face) at-rule.

`New presentational layouts` - In order to improve the flexibility of designs, two new layouts have been added: the CSS [multi-column](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Columns/Using_multi-column_layouts) layouts, CSS [flexible box](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) (Flexbox) layout, and [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout), for example.
